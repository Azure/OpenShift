# Managed OpenShift on Azure cluster - Supported Resources

## Azure Regions

The following is a list of currently supported Azure regions around the globe
where you can deploy your OpenShift managed clusters:

|Region|CLI code|
|-|-|
|ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡º Australia East|`australiaeast`|
|ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦ Canada Central|`canadacentral`|
|ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦ Canada East|`canadaeast`|
|ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ East US|`eastus`|
|ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ West US|`westus`|
|ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡º West Europe|`westeurope`|
|ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡º North Europe|`northeurope`|

## Azure  VM Sizes

The following is a list of supported virtual machine sizes you can specify for
the compute nodes in your OpenShift managed cluster. There is a couple of caveats
you must be aware of:

1. Each  VM has a different number of drives that can be attached. This may not
   be as immediately clear as memory or CPU size
2. Not all  VM sizes are available in _all_ regions. So even if the API may support
   the size you are sending, if the size is not available in the region, an error
   will be thrown
