# Create an Azure Red Hat OpenShift private cluster running OpenShift 4 (preview)

[!INCLUDE [openshift-preview.md](_includes/openshift-preview.md)]

In article, you'll prepare your environment to create Azure Red Hat OpenShift private clusters running OpenShift 4, currently in preview. You learn how to:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Setup the prerequisites and create the required virtual network and subnets
> * Deploy a cluster with a private API server endpoint and a private ingress controller
> * Connect to the cluster using the `kubeadmin` user

[!INCLUDE [cloud-shell-try-it.md](../../_includes/cloud-shell-try-it.md)]

If you choose to install and use the CLI locally, this tutorial requires that you are running the Azure CLI version 2.0.75 or later. Run `az --version` to find the version. If you need to install or upgrade, see [Install Azure CLI][azure-cli-install].

## Before you begin

### Install the 'az aro' extension
During this preview, you'll need to install the `az aro` extension. The `az aro` extension allows you to create, access, and delete Azure Red Hat OpenShift clusters directly from the command line using the Azure CLI.

> [!NOTE]
> The `az aro` extension is currently in preview. It may be changed or removed in a future release.

Run the following command to install the `az aro` extension.

```azurecli-interactive
az extension add -n aro --index https://az.aroapp.io/preview
```

If you already have the extension installed, you can update by running the following command.

```azurecli-interactive
az extension update -n aro --index https://az.aroapp.io/preview
```

### Register the preview resource provider

To opt-in for the preview you need to register the `Microsoft.RedHatOpenShift` resource provider in your subscription.

```azurecli-interactive
az provider register -n Microsoft.RedHatOpenShift --wait
```

Verify the extension is registered.

```azurecli-interactive
az -v
```

  You should get an output similar to the below.

```output
...
Extensions:
aro                                0.1.0
...
```

## Create a resource group

An Azure resource group is a logical group in which Azure resources are deployed and managed. When you create a resource group, you are asked to specify a location. This location is where resource group metadata is stored, it is also where your resources run in Azure if you don't specify another region during resource creation. Create a resource group using the [az group create][az-group-create] command.

The following example creates a resource group named *aro-rg* in the *eastus* location.

```azurecli-interactive
az group create --name aro-rg --location eastus
```

The following example output shows the resource group created successfully:

```json
{
  "id": "/subscriptions/<guid>/resourceGroups/aro-rg",
  "location": "eastus",
  "managedBy": null,
  "name": "aro-rg",
  "properties": {
    "provisioningState": "Succeeded"
  },
  "tags": null
}
```

## Create a virtual network

Azure Red Hat OpenShift clusters running OpenShift 4 require a virtual network with two empty subnets, for the master and worker nodes.

Create a new virtual network in the same resource group you created earlier, for example in *aro-rg*.

```azurecli-interactive
az network vnet create \
  --resource-group aro-rg \
  --name aro-vnet \
  --address-prefixes 10.0.0.0/8
```

The following example output shows the virtual network created successfully:

```json
{
  "newVNet": {
    "addressSpace": {
      "addressPrefixes": [
        "10.0.0.0/8"
      ]
    },
    "id": "/subscriptions/<guid>/resourceGroups/aro-rg/providers/Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/aro-vnet",
    "location": "eastus",
    "name": "aro-vnet",
    "provisioningState": "Succeeded",
    "resourceGroup": "aro-rg",
    "type": "Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks"
  }
}
```

Add an empty subnet for the master nodes.

```azurecli-interactive
az network vnet subnet create \
  --resource-group aro-rg \
  --vnet-name aro-vnet \
  --name master-subnet \
  --address-prefixes 10.0.1.0/24 \
  --service-endpoints Microsoft.ContainerRegistry 
```

Add an empty subnet for the worker nodes.

```azurecli-interactive
az network vnet subnet create \
  --resource-group aro-rg \
  --vnet-name aro-vnet \
  --name worker-subnet \
  --address-prefixes 10.1.0.0/20 \
  --service-endpoints Microsoft.ContainerRegistry 
```

[Disable subnet private endpoint policies](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/private-link/disable-private-link-service-network-policy) on the master subnet. This required to be able to connect and manage the cluster.

```azurecli-interactive
az network vnet subnet update \
  --name master-subnet \
  --resource-group aro-rg \
  --vnet-name aro-vnet \
  --disable-private-link-service-network-policies true
```

## Create the cluster

Run the following command to create a cluster. Note the `apiserver-visibility` and the `ingress-visibility` parameters. Optionally, you can pass a pull secret which enables your cluster to access Red Hat container registries along with additional content. Access your pull secret by navigating to the [Red Hat OpenShift Cluster Manager](https://cloud.redhat.com/openshift/install/azure/installer-provisioned) and clicking Copy Pull Secret.

```azurecli-interactive
az aro create \
  --resource-group aro-rg \
  --name aro-cluster \
  --vnet aro-vnet \
  --master-subnet master-subnet \
  --worker-subnet worker-subnet \
  --apiserver-visibility Private \
  --ingress-visibility Private
  # --domain aro.example.com # [OPTIONAL] custom domain
  # --pull-secret 'Pull secret from https://cloud.redhat.com/openshift/install/azure/installer-provisioned/' # [OPTIONAL]
```

>[!NOTE]
> It normally takes about 35 minutes to create a cluster.

>[!IMPORTANT]
> If you choose to specify a custom domain, for example **foo.example.com**, the OpenShift console will be available at a URL such as `https://console-openshift-console.apps.foo.example.com`, instead of the built-in domain `https://console-openshift-console.apps.<random>.<location>.aroapp.io`.
>
> By default OpenShift uses self-signed certificates for all of the routes created on `*.apps.<random>.<location>.aroapp.io`.  If you choose Custom DNS, after connecting to the cluster, you will need to follow the OpenShift documentation to [configure a custom CA for your ingress controller](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.3/authentication/certificates/replacing-default-ingress-certificate.html) and [custom CA for your API server](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.3/authentication/certificates/api-server.html).
>
> You can follow this article to [create testing certificates to use with your custom domain](../configure/custom-ca.md).

## Connect to the private cluster

You can log into the cluster using the `kubeadmin` user.  Run the following command to find the password for the `kubeadmin` user.

```azurecli-interactive
az aro list-credentials \
  --name aro-cluster \
  --resource-group aro-rg
```

The following example output shows the password will be in `kubeadminPassword`.

```json
{
  "kubeadminPassword": "<generated password>",
  "kubeadminUsername": "kubeadmin"
}
```

You can find the cluster console URL by running the following command, which will look like `https://console-openshift-console.apps.<random>.<region>.aroapp.io/`

```azurecli-interactive
 az aro show \
    --name aro-cluster \
    --resource-group aro-rg \
    --query "consoleProfile.url" -o tsv
```

>[!IMPORTANT]
> In order to connect to a private Azure Red Hat OpenShift cluster, you will need to perform the following step from a host that is either in the Virtual Network you created or in a Virtual Network that is [peered](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/virtual-network-peering-overview) with the Virtual Network the cluster was deployed to.

Launch the console URL in a browser and login using the `kubeadmin` credentials.

You can also download the latest release of the CLI appropriate to your machine from <https://mirror.openshift.com/pub/openshift-v4/clients/ocp/latest/>.

## Connect using the OpenShift CLI

Retrieve the API server's address.

```azurecli-interactive
apiServer=$(az aro show -g aro-rg -n aro-cluster --query apiserverProfile.url -o tsv)
```

>[!IMPORTANT]
> In order to connect to a private Azure Red Hat OpenShift cluster, you will need to perform the following step from a host that is either in the Virtual Network you created or in a Virtual Network that is [peered](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/virtual-network-peering-overview) with the Virtual Network the cluster was deployed to.

Login to the OpenShift cluster's API server using the following command. Replace **\<kubeadmin password>** with the password you just retrieved.

```azurecli-interactive
oc login $apiServer -u kubeadmin -p <kubeadmin password>
```
